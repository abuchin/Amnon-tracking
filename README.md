# Amnon-tracking
Comparision between Amnon and Chris data

The script Amnon_Chris_comparison.m compares Ca recordings from Chris and Amnon's data. All recordings are saved in 
Ca_traces_Chris_Amnon.mat. Each corresponding array stores the traces of neurons in the array. Rows correspond to the time frames, columns
correspond to the neurons. The datasets are taken to be of the same size to be comparable.
